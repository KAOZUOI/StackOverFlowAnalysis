IntelliJ IDEA checks all JDKs that are used in the project: the JDKs that are defined on both the project and module levels.IntelliJ IDEA calculates the latest of these JDKs. This is necessary to make sure that all modules can be compiled.If the version of the latest JDK configured is lower than 1.6, IntelliJ IDEA will pick the JDK version that is used for running the IDE. This limitation is related to the fact that the compiler API used by IntelliJ IDEA for building projects is supported starting from JDK 1.6.
